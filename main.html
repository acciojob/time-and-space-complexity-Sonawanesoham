<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm with efficient time complexity executes quickly even for large inputs.</p>

<p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the length of the input. In terms of memory usage, algorithms with Space Complexity of O(n) are considered efficient. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in optimizing algorithms.</p>
